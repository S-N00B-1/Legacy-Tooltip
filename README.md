# Console Tooltip![About](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49575478/204980530-cd79afab-2a11-46e0-9717-39cb5a90a289.png)
In the legacy console version of Minecraft (PS3, Wii U, Xbox 360 Era) tooltips and potion effects looked like this!

This pack does not require Iris or Optifine to run, install it as a resource pack and enable it. Works for versions 1.17 and above.
